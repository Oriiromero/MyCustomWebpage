                        <p>I'm originally from Argentina, living in Madrid for a year now!<br>
                            One of my favorite things to do is watch superhero movies with chips, reading and learning stuff to keep the brain working.<br>
                            In my to do list I'll put learning german, but that's a story for another day!

                    <p>The thing that motivates me the most is not being stuck and be able to work in something that provides me knowledge everyday,
                        and for me to put my knowledge in a project or to improve it. <br> Doing stuff alone is amazing, but having someone that can also teach
                        you is incredible.

                            I worked for almost three years as a customer client assistant in a small company in Argentina.<br>
                            As my first job ever, I learned not only how to do it right but also about responsability and consistance.<br>
                            I'll always be grateful for the things they gave me and will forever remember it with joy.

                          As my second job, It has been a great professional but also personal challenge since I was in a new country 
                          with people very different from me.<br>
                          It has taught me so much about problem solving, staying calm and working under pressure.<br>
                          But most importantly, it has taught me to feel comfortable moving forward from a challenging situation 
                          without letting it drag me down.

                      One of my favorite subjects were art and biology, nothing very social oriented I know.

                     I'm not going to lie to you, I love makeup and skin care, but what I like the most is to pass on my knowledge to the people around me and see how little by little they start doing the things I teach them.

                      I started this course with very low expectations and I can say that it ended up being a super fun experience. <br>
                      I learned a lot not only about flavour combinations, but also about myself, how far I'm willing to go, how                
                      much time I want to spend on it and about standing out. And yes, I make delicious cocktails.

                     Finally here I am now. Started this in 2021, but wanted to do it for a very long time.<br>
                      I won't lie, it was ruff and difficult, as a person who had no knowledge at all about programming languages<br>
                      it was <strong>h a r d</strong>. But I found the beauty on it, when you have those "eureka" times and you figured something out that was
                      for you impossible, there's no better feeling than the "I'm invincible" one and that you can do whatever you want.
